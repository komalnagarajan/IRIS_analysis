# IRIS_analysis
Goal :
Finding Optimum Number of Clusters and providing a visual representation.
Dataset Used: 
Iris Dataset.
Overview of the Project:
Being an unsupervised learning problem, K-Means clustering is the algorithm used to perform the clustering proces. To find the optimal numbe rof clusters, two different approaches are made on the K-Means model. One is the Elbow graph method, where one can determine the number of clusters depending upon the formation of the elbow in the graph. 
Another approach is to use the Silhoutte graph to determine the number of clusters. The best one can be choosen by looking at the thicknesss and the threshold levels for each cluster from the graph.
With these two methods, the optimal number is built based on the choosen number of clusters and its output is visualized using a scattered plot.
